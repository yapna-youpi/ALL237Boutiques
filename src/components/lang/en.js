    moreSous2: " Born from the dual observation of the explosion of Mobile Money and the demand for cryptocurrency in Africa, IPERCash is a platform essentially based on Blockchain and decentralized finance.",
    moreSous3: "Why the merger of Mobile Money and cryptocurrency is certainly the future of Africa and most likely of the rest of the world?  The banking rate in Africa is extremely low, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa . From where a dazzling penetration of Mobile Money making it possible to obtain an electronic wallet without constraints. Mobile Money works by USSD codes compatible with any phone, so this service does not require a sophisticated phone",
    moreSous4: "On the other hand, cryptocurrency, particularly ethereum, Bitcoin and usdt are also experiencing unexpected penetration in Africa.",
    moreSous5: " Indeed, the conditions dictated by local central banks and their depreciated local currencies are forcing local businesses and pushing them to turn to much more flexible cryptocurrency.",
    moreSous6: "We are therefore a platform for exchanges and interactions between Mobile Money and cryptocurrency and a necessity. <br/> We are an Internet cross platform and mobile application where users can:",
    moreSous7: "- Buy cryptocurrency by credit card and deposit it in a Mobile Money account in Africa.",
    moreSous8: "- Buy cryptocurrency to credit their electronic wallet;",
    moreSous9: "- Buy cryptocurrency by paying with Mobile Money",
    moreSous10: "- Withdraw cryptocurrency from his wallet and transfer it to his Mobile Money account.",
    moreSous11: "IPERCash is not a trading society, IPERCash does not offer financial products or speculative investments but intends to participate in the increase in the volume of cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.",
    moreSous12: "We are therefore offering Africans the opportunity to purchase services and products in cryptocurrency, and vice versa, to be paid in cryptocurrency.",
